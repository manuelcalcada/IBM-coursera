# Machine Learning with Python course by IBM + Coursera

This repo presents some solutions to the labs of this [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python), that dives into the basics of machine learning using an approachable, and well-known programming language, Python. 

The works were done for the following laboratories:

  - Simple Linear Regression
  - Multiple Linear Regression
  - Polynomial Regression
  - KNN Classification
  - Decision Trees Classification
  - Logistic Regression Classification
  - Support Vector Machines Classification
  - K-Means Clustering
  - Hieralchical Clustering

Finally, this repository also presents my final project for the course.
